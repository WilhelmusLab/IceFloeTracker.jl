##### Default settings ######
# dmw: Should these be exported variables? Or should there be a function that
# returns the defaults? I'm placing them here temporarily, with the intent
# of including these in a file such as segmentation-lopez-acosta-2019.jl.

# TODO: Set these to match the Lopez-Acosta 2019 paper
# TODO: Generalize area filtering. We could have a size-dependent floe filter function. Here it's two-step, but it doesn't have to be.
# TODO: The size-dependent geometric thresholds can also be a function, e.g. geometric_filter_function(area, ratios...)
# TODO: Replace references to condition_thresholds in function documentation
