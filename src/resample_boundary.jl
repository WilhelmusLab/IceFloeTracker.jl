# resample pixels on floe boundary for psi-s curve

"""
    resample_boundary(bd_points::Vector{CartesianIndex}, reduc_factor::Int64=2)

Get a uniform set of resampled boundary points from `bd_points` using cubic splines with 'natural' boundary conditions

The resampled set of points is obtained using parametric interpolation of the points in `bd_points`. It is assumed that the separation between a pair of adjacent points is 1.

# Arguments
- `bd_points`: Sequetial set of boundary points for the object of interest
- `reduc_factor`: factor by which to reduce the number of points in `bd_points`
