Example case with forty known floes labeled like `day_<obs>-#<floe id>`, e.g., `day_1-#31` 
This case exhibited a bug fixed in PR #616 where 
- some trajectories would have two entries for a particular day, and 
- some floes would be duplicated in the trajectory list.

This larger dataset is useful as a performance test.
